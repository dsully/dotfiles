  # In my experience, false positive detection in typos occurred for short words.
  #
  # * My typos are increased as the words get longer
  # * Too short often conflict with hash strings especially `ba`: https://github.com/crate-ci/typos/issues/415
  # * Added 2 or 3 character abbreviations as wrong: https://github.com/crate-ci/typos/issues/955

  # So I guess skipping all these detections makes reasonable behaviors for now and for the future.
